        <a href="#a11y">A11y</a> (pronounced "ally") is short for accessibility—making digital spaces usable for everyone. It means designing websites, apps, and tools so people with disabilities (like vision, hearing, or mobility challenges) can navigate, understand, and interact with them. Think screen readers, captions, keyboard-friendly layouts, and clear designs. A11y isn't just compliance; it's about ensuring everyone has equal access to information and opportunities online.

      <p>A11y is essential for non-profits. It ensures that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can access your resources, participate in your events, and connect with your mission. By focusing on accessibility, you’re not only broadening your reach but also demonstrating a real commitment to inclusion. It’s a practical way to live out your values, deepen your impact, and ensure no one is excluded. A11y isn’t just a checkbox—it’s about making your work truly welcoming for all.</p>
