      <h1>Clean Web Development</h1>
      
      <h2>Privacy by Design, Not by Accident</h2>
      <p>
        Most websites today are digital surveillance machines masquerading as helpful tools. They track your movements, harvest your data, and sell your attention to the highest bidder. We believe the web can be better than that.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Clean web development starts with a simple principle: respect your users. That means being transparent about what data you collect (spoiler: it should be almost none), why you collect it, and what you do with it. It means building sites that work great without JavaScript, load lightning-fast on slow connections, and never trick users into doing things they don't want to do.
      </p>

      <h2>No Dark Patterns, Just Good Design</h2>
      <p>
        Dark patterns are those sneaky design tricks that manipulate users into taking actions they didn't intend—like subscribing to newsletters they never wanted, or making it impossible to cancel subscriptions. They're everywhere, and they're awful.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We design interfaces that are genuinely helpful. Clear buttons that do what they say. Easy opt-outs. Honest pricing. Forms that collect only what's necessary. Because good design doesn't need to trick people—it simply serves them well.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookie-Free by Default</h2>
      <p>
        Here's a wild idea: what if websites didn't need to ask permission to track you because they simply... didn't track you? Most sites can function perfectly well without cookies. Analytics can be privacy-respecting. Forms can work without storing personal data unnecessarily.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When we do use cookies, they're functional ones that make the site work better for you—not advertising cookies that follow you around the internet. And we're always transparent about what we're doing and why.
      </p>

      <h2>Performance That Doesn't Compromise</h2>
      <p>
        Clean code is fast code. When you're not loading dozens of tracking scripts, advertising networks, and surveillance tools, your site naturally performs better. Users get faster load times, better battery life, and less data usage.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We build sites that work great on older devices, slower connections, and with assistive technologies. Because digital equity means everyone deserves a fast, accessible web experience—regardless of their device or connection speed.
      </p>

      <h2>Radical Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        Want to know how your site was built? We'll show you. Curious about our hosting choices? Here's our reasoning. Wondering about our tech stack? It's all documented and explained.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Transparency builds trust, and trust builds better relationships with your audience. When people understand your choices and values, they're more likely to engage authentically with your work.
