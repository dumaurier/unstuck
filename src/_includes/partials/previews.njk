      <h2>Accessibility & Equity</h2>
    <p>Accessibility is how you make sure your site doesn’t slam the door on anyone—it’s the difference between a velvet rope and a busted-open portal where screen readers, slow connections, shaky hands, and tired brains are all welcome to come in and raise hell (or just read your blog).</p>

    <h2>What is an Ethical Digital Strategy</h2>
  <p>
    An ethical digital strategy is about building your online presence with purpose. It means being intentional with how you share, connect, and create in digital spaces—guided by your values, not just by trends or algorithms.
  </p>

  <p>It's about choosing tools and tactics that reflect care—for your community, for your audience, and for the planet. By approaching your website this way, you're not just building something functional or beautiful—you're making something meaningful. Something that reflects who you are, what you stand for, and how you want to show up in the world.</p>

  <p>Ethical strategy doesn't limit your creativity—it makes it deeper, more aligned, and more impactful.</p>

    <h2>Digital Sovereignty & The Fediverse</h2>
    <p>
      The fediverse represents a new approach to social networking—one that's decentralized, community-owned, and built on open protocols. Unlike mainstream platforms controlled by corporations, fediverse networks (like Mastodon, PeerTube, and Pixelfed) are interconnected yet independently operated.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means greater digital sovereignty: the ability to control your online presence, data, and connections without being subject to algorithmic manipulation or surveillance capitalism. For organizations and communities, the fediverse offers a way to engage authentically, build genuine connections, and align your digital presence with your values.

    <h2>Fediverse and IndieWeb</h2>
    <p>
      The IndieWeb movement champions web ownership—creating and maintaining your own website as your primary online identity. It's about taking back control from platforms that monetize your content and attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      By combining IndieWeb principles with fediverse connections, you can create a powerful, independent digital presence that still enables social interaction. Your content lives on your own domain, but can be shared and discussed across the decentralized social web. This approach gives you the best of both worlds: ownership and community.
